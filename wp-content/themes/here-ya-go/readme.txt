Setup
-----
Install and activate - that’s all! 

Might add color selection later on, but right now it can be edited quickly if you’re using Scss by changing the following variables and recompiling:

$primary-color
$secondary-color
$tertiary-color

The SCSS uses the newest versions of Compass and Susy as of March 4th, 2014.

Note that galleries use prettyPhoto, and default to linking directly to the file.  Linking to the attachment page is disabled.
